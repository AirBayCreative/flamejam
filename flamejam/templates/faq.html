<h2>What is a gamejam?</h2>

<div class="info">
    <p>
        A game jam is an event during which all participants create
        games according to a provided theme within a short amount of
        time (usually between two days to a week). Check out the
        <a href="{{ url_for('rules') }}#procedure">rules page</a> for
        details on the procedure.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>Who can participate?</h2>
<div class="info">
    <p>
        <b>Everyone.</b> It is as simple as that.
    </p>
    <p>
        You probably want a reddit account, since this is the reddit
        game jam. You do not need any skills, you will gain them here.
        We won't exclude anyone for their inexperience.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>What type of games are created?</h2>
<div class="info">
    <p>
        Difficult to say. We want to achieve a wide range of different
        game types. Games are also rated for their <i>innovative factor</i>,
        and some games submitted have unique gameplay mechanisms. Of course
        there are always some games of the main video game genres, but
        that depends on the theme and the creativity of the author.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have the courage to try something completely new. It's worth it!

<h2>How do I make a game?</h2>
<div class="info">
    <p>
        Never did it before? No problem! The game jams are a learning
        effort, so newbies are also welcome. But to make sure you will
        have something playable within this shourt amount of time you
        should prepare for the event. Tips for greenhorns:
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>For programmers:</b>
        <ul class="normal">
            <li>First learn programming, then game development. Many people
            think this is the same, but actually there is a huge difference.
            It's good to know how to program, but making a game is much
            more. You also need art, maths, a story, a lot of creativity
            and a good time management.</li>
            <li>Find an easy programming language/framework/engine. You
            probably do not want to start of coding C on OpenGL level.
            Find something that suits you. You are even allowed to use
            game creation software where you only have to drag 'n' drop
            your components together.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>For everyone:</b>
        <ul class="normal">
            <li>Team up! While working with other people who are more
            experienced than you you learn a lot faster than alone. Wait
            for a <i>team jam</i> and find people to work with. There are
            lots of skilled game developers here, just ask.</li>
            <li>Join as an artist. Every game needs some art, and every
            programmer loves artists. You will contribute an important
            part to a game project, even if you don't write a single line
            of code.</li>
        </ul>
